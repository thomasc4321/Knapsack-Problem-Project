These algorithms were originally written for my Extended Essay project as part
of my IB lukio education, before formally studying computer science in
university. The code has been commented and somewhat refactored from my 
original code, which can be seen at the bottom of my EE pdf.

The written project also includes my original lukio analysis of these
algorithms, my testing, and an explanation of the knapsack problem.
